# Opencall

Opencall is the world's first (and only) open source call tracking software. The software is 
available under the GPL v3 license, is written in PHP and utilises MySQL as the database platform.

The original Opencall source code was written and developed by Opencall Hong Kong to service 
clients in Hong Kong and other Asian countries. After 8 months of internal development the founder 
of Opencall, Scott Bowler, decided to release their proprietary code to the public and change 
his business model to servicing companies who would make use of the open source call tracking platform. 
The major driver behind this choice was to open up the product to a global user base and encourage 
more rapid development of the platform.
