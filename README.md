# Opencall

[Opencall] (http://www.ocall.org) is the world's first open source call tracking platform.

Call tracking is a method of monitoring inbound phone calls. It allows you to record conversations, 
track key statistics such as caller id, call duration, call source and a variety of other metrics. 
Why? It helps you to reduce advertising budget wastage, increase sales and improve customer service. 
Opencall is the worldâ€™s first (and only) open source call tracking software. 

The software is available under the GPL v3 license, is written in PHP and utilises MySQL as 
the database platform.
